# Brookstone Rover Example

In the Brookstone Rover example we implement a real-world version of the Hexagonal example, and demonstrate batch-processing in Graff using a simple \$100 robot. The robot is cheap, the data is messy, and we still a good solution. Concepts highlighted:
    1. Integrating Graff with MIT's LCM to process an LCM log
    1. Processing offline camera data
    1. Visualization
