# Visualization
Graff allows you to visualize you data in a browser with MeshCat. You can draw nodes, data, or sessions straight from your data source. At the moment this is in development, so please let us know if there are important features that you would like to see by adding an issue to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/GearsAD/GraffSDK.jl.git) and tag it with 'visualization'.

NOTE: This may change as we move visualization to Arena.jl.
